# Information Retrieval Project

This is a project for the Information Retrieval course (CSE-508) offered at IIIT Delhi, which aims to develop and evaluate techniques for lexical text simplification and detoxification. The project investigates the challenges of developing effective simplification techniques that accurately preserve the meaning and intended tone and style of the original text. The project also explores methods for detecting and detoxifying offensive text. The results of the project are presented in Jupyter Notebook files and a report for the mid-project evaluation, along with files related to deploying the models through a user-friendly web interface.

## Lexical Text Simplification

The proposed solution for lexical text simplification involves three main steps. 
* Firstly, complex words in the sentence are identified using the difficult_words function from the textstat library. 
* Secondly, the identified word is masked and replaced using the masked language modeling feature provided by BERT, and a list of the most appropriate words that can replace the masked word is generated. 
* Finally, the most appropriate replacement word is chosen based on the cosine similarity between the original and modified sentence, and the sum of the Zipf frequency of all words in the original and modified sentence is calculated to compare their complexity.

## Detoxification
As part of our model, we developed a model that performs the following tasks: 
* It detects whether a sentence or comment contains toxic content
* It catgorizes the toxic words in the comment which are replaced by their closest meaning, considerably less toxic sysnonyms to make itsuitable for readers of all ages. 
* To classify the text, we employed a machine learning algorithm that uses word vector embeddings generated by Word2Vec. We experimented with several ML models and the Jigsaw dataset was used for training the model. 
* After synonym replacement, we paraphrase the sentence to bring it closer to its original meaning (thus retaining context).
