# Information Retrieval Project

This is a project for the Information Retrieval course (CSE-508) offered at IIIT Delhi, which aims to develop and evaluate techniques for lexical text simplification and detoxification. The project investigates the challenges of developing effective simplification techniques that accurately preserve the meaning and intended tone and style of the original text. The project also explores methods for detecting and detoxifying offensive text. The results of the project are presented in Jupyter Notebook files and a report for the mid-project evaluation, along with files related to deploying the models through a user-friendly web interface.
